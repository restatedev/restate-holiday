# Restate Holiday

This repository demonstrates the [Saga pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/implement-the-serverless-saga-pattern-by-using-aws-step-functions.html)
in Restate. The example is based on AWS's [Step Functions sample implementation](https://github.com/aws-samples/step-functions-workflows-collection/tree/main/saga-pattern-tf)
of the pattern and associated Holiday booking service.

The goal of this example is to show how you can easily move a fairly complex AWS Step Functions workflow into code
using Restate. Instead of designing a graph of operations including failure compensations, you can just execute steps
imperatively, using try/catch/finally statements to do error control. You also don't need to make a distinction between
workflow and lambda code; everything is Lambda.

The original example has 9 Lambdas:

- Reserve/Confirm/Cancel flight
- Reserve/Confirm/Cancel car reservation
- Process/Refund payment
- Kick off the workflow (called by API gateway)

And some other components:

- API gateway
- A Step Functions workflow with 12 steps

Instead, we have 4 Lambda deployments, each corresponding to a single service from the domain:

- The [Trip service](./src/trips.ts), the entrypoint which orchestrates the whole thing, which you can call directly via
  the Restate HTTP ingress endpoint
- The [Flight service](./src/flights.ts), with methods for reserve/confirm/cancel
- The [Car service](./src/cars.ts), with methods for reserve/confirm/cancel
- The [Payment service](./src/payments.ts), with methods for process/refund

## Deploying with self-hosted Restate instance

In order to accept incoming requests over HTTPS we need a certificate to use with the Restate ingress endpoint. If you
have a certificate you would like to use, you can specify it in the `INGRESS_CERTIFICATE_ARN` environment variable.
Alternatively, you can create and import a new self-signed certificate:

```shell
bin/create-certificate.sh
export INGRESS_CERTIFICATE_ARN=$(aws acm list-certificates \
  --query "CertificateSummaryList[?DomainName=='restate.example.com'].CertificateArn" --output text)
```

You can also set the certificate ARN via the `ingressCertificateArn` CDK context attribute, either on the command line
or by editing the `cdk.json` file. This may be helpful if you want to deploy changes to the stack with CDK in the
future, without having to set the environment variable again.

By default, the Holiday CDK app will deploy two stacks: a self-hosted Restate instance, and the Holiday service stack.

```shell
npx cdk deploy --all
```

If you are deploying this stack in a shared AWS account, you may want to specify a prefix for the stack names:

```shell
npx cdk deploy --all --context prefix=${USER}
```

You can also deploy only the self-hosted Restate stack as follows:

```shell
npx cdk deploy RestateStack
```

You can save the ingress endpoint URL for later testing using the command below. If you specified a certificate earlier,
the endpoint URL should use HTTPS.

```shell
export INGRESS=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name RestateStack \
    --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='RestateIngressEndpoint'].OutputValue" \
    --output text)
```

Note that if you used a stack prefix, you will need to update the stack name above accordingly. You can now jump to the
[Invoking](#Invoking) section which shows you how to send some requests to the service.

When you are done testing, you can easily delete all created resources with the command (if you specified a prefix
during deployment, you will need to use the same value here too):

```shell
npx cdk destroy --all
```

## Deploying against Restate managed service

`MANAGED_SERVICE_CLUSTER=<your-cluster> cdk deploy` will set up everything you need in your AWS account. To discover the Lambdas to your managed Restate cluster:

```shell
# get stack outputs into your shell
eval $(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack RestateHolidayStack  --query "Stacks[].Outputs[]" | jq -r '.[] | "export " + .ExportName + "=" + .OutputValue')
for arn in ${tripsLambdaArn} ${carsLambdaArn} ${paymentsLambdaArn} ${flightsLambdaArn}; do
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-cluster-token>" https://<your-cluster>.dev.restate.cloud:9070/endpoints --json "{\"arn\": \"$arn\", \"assume_role_arn\": \"${assumeRoleArn}\"}"
done
```

This discovered a specific version, so you'll need to run this again if you update the Lambda functions.

See [the Managed Service docs](https://docs.restate.dev/restate/managed_service#giving-permission-for-your-cluster-to-invoke-your-lambdas) for more information

## Deploying against local Restate

Restate services don't care if they're running in a Lambda or not.
You can start a local instance of the services in one binary, which will use your local AWS creds

```shell
# get stack outputs into your shell
eval $(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack RestateHolidayStack  --query "Stacks[].Outputs[]" | jq -r '.[] | "export " + .ExportName + "=" + .OutputValue')
FLIGHTS_TABLE_NAME=${flightsTableName} CARS_TABLE_NAME=$carsTableName PAYMENTS_TABLE_NAME=${paymentsTableName} npm run app-dev
```

And you can start a local Restate instance and discover the service:

```
docker run --name restate_dev --rm -d --network=host ghcr.io/restatedev/restate-dist:0.4.0
curl localhost:9070/endpoints --json '{"uri": "http://localhost:9080"}'
```

You can even expose your local service over [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and route all new invocations from a remote cluster to your machine:

```shell
ngrok tcp 9080
# get the tcp endpoint like tcp://6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:14640 and change tcp -> http
curl <remote-restate-cluster>/endpoints --json '{"uri": "http://6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:14640"}'
```

You can also deploy against localstack AWS services using [`cdklocal`](https://github.com/localstack/aws-cdk-local)
and [`awslocal`](https://github.com/localstack/awscli-local):

```shell
cdklocal deploy
# get stack outputs into your shell
eval $(awslocal cloudformation describe-stacks --stack RestateHolidayStack  --query "Stacks[].Outputs[]" | jq -r '.[] | "export " + .ExportName + "=" + .OutputValue')
AWS_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4566 FLIGHTS_TABLE_NAME=restate-holiday-Flights CARS_TABLE_NAME=restate-holiday-Rentals PAYMENTS_TABLE_NAME=restate-holiday-Payments npm run app-dev
```

## Invoking

Note that we use the `-k` flag to skip certificate validation and make requests work against an ingress endpoint using a
self-signed certificate. If you are testing against a Managed Restate service or with a valid certificate, you can omit
this flag.

```shell
curl -k $INGRESS/trips/reserve --json '{}'
```

You can cause a specific type of failure by making a request with one of the following failure types:

- `failFlightsReservation`
- `failFlightsConfirmation`
- `failCarRentalReservation`
- `failCarRentalConfirmation`
- `failPayment`
- `failNotification`

```shell
curl -k $INGRESS/trips/reserve --json '{"request": {"run_type": "failPayment"}}'
```

You may also provide a trip ID of your choice:

```shell
curl -k $INGRESS/trips/reserve --json '{"request": {"trip_id": "foo"}}'
```

Finally, you can make an idempotent invocation by setting the `idempotency-key` header:

```shell
curl -k $INGRESS/trips/reserve -H 'idempotency-key: <unique-key>' --json '{}'
```

## Observability

### Logs

The Restate container deployed by the CDK construct will publish its logs to CloudWatch logs. You can view them in the
console or follow them from a terminal using the AWS CLI:

```shell
aws logs tail /restate/restate --follow
```

If you specified a deployment prefix, the log group will be called `/restate/<prefix>/restate`.

### Traces

The self-hosted Restate container is configured to send traces to AWS X-Ray, by way of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.
You should see traces in the X-Ray console including for health checks made by the load balancer. To filter just the
traces made to the demo Trips service, use a query like:

```
service(id(name: "trips"))
```
